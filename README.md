# CSAssignment2RunApp
This is a running app that uses Blynk, Raspberry Pi, MQTT and Wia

The main code that is being used as a server is the index.js and this takes
in the data and displays data from the Blynk app, then it is sent to Wia 
applocation and there it will be displayed through analytics on the screen.
Also there are flows that will use the data to send an email, if the distance i have travelled is
over 1km and below 1.1km. and same goes for 3km and 6km as demonstartion purposes.
Also a tweet will be sent out on my twitter account when i have reached a speed exceeding the 
12km which i have set. i will demonstarte all this in a you tube video.
Also i have a publisher and subsriber system setup using MQTT which will be domenstarted in the video
and there is a publisher and subscriber set up displaying the imformation processed into Wia,
just did two variations to demonstarte my knowledge on each.
